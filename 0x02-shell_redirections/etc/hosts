The error "Unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'` typically indicates that there is a missing closing quotation mark in your script. It means that the shell encountered the end of the file (`EOF`) while it was still expecting to find a closing quotation mark (`"`).

To resolve this error, you need to ensure that all opening and closing quotation marks in your script are properly balanced. Here are a few suggestions to fix the issue:

1. Check for missing or unbalanced quotation marks: Review your script and verify that all quotation marks are correctly opened and closed. Make sure that each opening quotation mark has a corresponding closing quotation mark.

2. Pay attention to any special characters: If your script contains special characters or escape sequences within quotation marks, ensure that they are properly escaped or handled to avoid causing unbalanced quotations.

3. Use a text editor with syntax highlighting: Consider using a text editor that supports syntax highlighting for the programming/scripting language you are using. Syntax highlighting can help identify unbalanced quotations or other syntax errors by highlighting them in a different color.

4. Use a shell syntax checker or linter: Utilize a shell syntax checker or linter tool that can detect syntax errors in your script. These tools can provide more specific error messages and highlight issues such as unbalanced quotes.

By carefully examining your script and ensuring that all opening and closing quotation marks are properly matched, you should be able to resolve the "Unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'` error.
